# Agile Workflows & Kanban ‚Äì Reflection

## üîç Research & Learn

**How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?**  
A Kanban board provides a visual representation of the team‚Äôs workflow, allowing everyone to track progress and identify bottlenecks quickly. At Focus Bear, the board is organised into multiple columns representing different stages of work ‚Äî from initial planning to completion. Each task is a card containing a short description, tags, and sometimes linked issues or pull requests.

**What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent?**  
From the Focus Bear Mobile team board:

- **Backlog** ‚Äì Tasks and ideas that are planned but not yet started.
- **In Progress** ‚Äì Items currently being worked on.
- **Testing / Verification** ‚Äì Completed work under review or testing.
- **Done** ‚Äì Finalised tasks ready for closure.
- **Unable to Replicate / Blocked** ‚Äì Items that cannot progress due to missing information or dependencies.

**How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?**  
Tasks typically move left to right as work progresses. When a team member starts a task, they drag it into **In Progress**; once completed, it moves to **Testing/Verification**. After approval, it moves to **Done**. The task owner is responsible for updating its position and status.

**What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?**

- Prevents overloading team members
- Improves focus and quality
- Makes bottlenecks visible early
- Helps complete tasks faster before starting new ones

## üìù Reflection

**How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?**  
In the Focus Bear workflow, Kanban makes it easy to see which tasks are high priority (through tags and ordering in columns) and limits the number of items in **In Progress**. This prevents team members from juggling too many tasks at once and ensures important work gets completed sooner.

**How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?**  
I can improve my own workflow by:

1. Regularly updating task statuses to reflect real-time progress
2. Keeping only a small number of tasks in progress
3. Reviewing **Blocked/Unable to Replicate** items more frequently to remove obstacles quickly

## üõ†Ô∏è Task

**Observation from Focus Bear‚Äôs Kanban board (GitHub Projects):**  
Tasks are grouped by month (e.g., **August Tasks**) and each card includes clear descriptions, labels, and references to GitHub issues. This makes it easy to track development progress and understand task context at a glance.

**Action taken:**  
I moved one assigned mobile app task from **In Progress** to **Testing/Verification** after completing implementation and initial checks.

**One improvement idea:**  
Add a **"Ready for Review"** column between **Testing** and **Done** to separate completed but unapproved work from fully finished tasks.
