# Kanban Board – Research, Reflection, and Task

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?

A Kanban board is a visual tool used to manage workflow by showing tasks as cards that move through different stages (columns). It helps teams see what’s being worked on, what’s coming up, and what’s completed. The visual format makes it easy to track progress, identify bottlenecks, and maintain a steady flow of work.

### What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent?

Common columns include:

- **Backlog** – Ideas, requests, or tasks that are planned but not yet started.
- **In Progress** – Tasks actively being worked on.
- **Blocked** – Tasks that cannot move forward due to a dependency or issue.
- **Done** – Tasks that have been completed.

### How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?

Tasks (cards) move from left to right as work progresses.

- Team members are usually responsible for updating the status of the tasks they are working on.
- In collaborative teams, updates may happen during daily stand-ups or when work status changes.

### What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?

- Reduces multitasking and context switching.
- Improves focus on fewer tasks, leading to faster completion.
- Makes bottlenecks visible so they can be resolved quickly.
- Encourages finishing work before starting new tasks.

## 📝 Reflection

### How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?

Kanban provides visibility of all tasks in one place, making it easier to see priorities at a glance. WIP limits ensure team members don’t take on too much at once, which prevents burnout and keeps quality high.

### How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?

I can:

- Regularly review and prioritize the **Backlog** so the most important work is ready for the next stage.
- Use WIP limits to stay focused on completing current tasks before starting new ones.
- Update task status in real-time to maintain an accurate view of progress for the team.

## 🛠️ Task

### Observation of Focus Bear’s Kanban Board

- Tasks are organized into clear columns: Backlog → In Progress → Review → Done.
- Each card contains a clear title, description, and assignee.

### Action Taken

- Moved one task from **In Progress** to **Review** after completing the main work.
- Updated the task’s description with the latest details before moving it.

### Improvement Suggestion for Task Tracking

- Add labels or tags for **priority level** (High, Medium, Low) so it’s easier to see urgent work at a glance.
