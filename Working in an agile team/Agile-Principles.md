## üîç Research & Learn

### What is Agile and How It Differs from Traditional Project Management

Agile is an iterative and flexible approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, continuous improvement, and responding to change.  
**Traditional project management** (like Waterfall) follows a linear process with fixed stages, whereas Agile allows for changes throughout the project and delivers work in smaller, manageable increments.

### Core Values and Principles of Agile (Agile Manifesto)

**Core Values:**

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation.
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
4. Responding to change over following a plan.

**Key Principles:**

- Deliver working software frequently.
- Welcome changing requirements.
- Maintain close, daily collaboration between business and technical teams.
- Build projects around motivated individuals.
- Reflect regularly and adapt accordingly.

### Scrum vs. Kanban

**Scrum:**

- Fixed-length iterations called sprints (usually 2‚Äì4 weeks).
- Defined roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.
- Uses sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives.
- Focused on delivering a set scope each sprint.

**Kanban:**

- Continuous flow with no fixed iterations.
- Focus on visualizing work and limiting work in progress (WIP).
- Tasks can be reprioritized at any time.
- No prescribed roles or ceremonies.

### Why Focus Bear Uses Kanban

- Flexibility to adapt priorities quickly.
- Easier to accommodate changing requirements.
- Suits a small, fast-moving team where tasks vary in size and complexity.

### Benefits of Agile

- Faster feedback and iteration cycles.
- Better alignment between development and QA.
- Greater adaptability to user needs and bug discoveries.

### Challenges of Agile

- Requires strong communication to avoid confusion.
- Risk of scope creep if priorities change too often.
- Can be overwhelming if WIP limits are not respected.

### How Agile Principles Can Improve My Role

- **Continuous collaboration** ensures QA feedback is incorporated quickly.
- **Transparency** through the Kanban board helps me prioritize testing based on development progress.
- **Iterative delivery** allows me to test smaller changes more thoroughly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Task Responses

**1. Main differences between Scrum and Kanban in my own words:**  
Scrum works in fixed sprints with defined roles and regular ceremonies, focusing on delivering a specific set of tasks within each sprint. Kanban uses a continuous flow approach, allowing tasks to be added or reprioritized anytime, with a focus on limiting work in progress and maintaining steady throughput.

**2. One Agile principle most useful in my work:**  
**‚ÄúResponding to change over following a plan‚Äù** ‚Äì This helps me adapt my testing approach quickly when features or priorities shift, ensuring I focus on what‚Äôs most valuable at the time.
