## üîç Research & Learn

### Main Agile Ceremonies and Their Purpose

**1. Daily Stand-ups**

- **Purpose:** A short, focused meeting (usually 15 minutes) for the team to share progress, blockers, and priorities for the day.
- **Benefit:** Keeps everyone aligned and allows quick identification of issues.

**2. Sprint Planning (Scrum) vs. Continuous Prioritization (Kanban)**

- **Sprint Planning (Scrum):** The team plans the work for the next sprint, setting clear goals and deliverables.
- **Continuous Prioritization (Kanban):** Work items are reviewed and reprioritized continuously, allowing flexibility and quick adjustments.

**3. Retrospectives**

- **Purpose:** Reflect on the last sprint or period to identify what went well, what didn‚Äôt, and how to improve.
- **Benefit:** Promotes continuous improvement and open communication.

**4. Backlog Refinement**

- **Purpose:** Review and update backlog items, clarify requirements, and ensure tasks are ready for future work.
- **Benefit:** Keeps the backlog relevant and prioritized.

### How Agile Teams Collaborate Asynchronously and Across Time Zones

- Use of shared Kanban boards (e.g., Jira, Trello) to track progress.
- Clear documentation in tickets and task descriptions.
- Recorded video updates or written summaries for those unable to attend live meetings.
- Asynchronous messaging via Slack or similar tools, with @mentions for urgent updates.

### How Agile Ceremonies Help with Communication and Alignment

- Ensure everyone knows current priorities and blockers.
- Provide a regular forum to raise concerns or request help.
- Create opportunities for continuous feedback and improvement.

### Most Important Ceremony for My Role

- **Daily Stand-up:**  
  As a QA intern, daily stand-ups are essential because they help me:
  - Identify which features or fixes are ready for testing.
  - Communicate any bugs or blockers immediately.
  - Stay in sync with the development timeline.

## üõ†Ô∏è Task Responses

**1. Attend a Stand-up Meeting and Observe Updates**

- Observed that each team member shared:
  - What they did yesterday.
  - What they plan to do today.
  - Any blockers they are facing.
- This helped me know which tasks to prioritize for testing.

**2. Participate in a Retrospective or Review Past Notes**

- Reviewed past retrospective notes and saw action items such as:
  - Reducing the number of work-in-progress items.
  - Improving task description clarity.
- These align with my QA need for well-documented testing requirements.

**3. Document One Change to Improve Team Collaboration**

- I will start adding **clear reproduction steps and screenshots** for every bug I report.  
  This will help developers quickly understand and address issues without needing multiple follow-ups.
