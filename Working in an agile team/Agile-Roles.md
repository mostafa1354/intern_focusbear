### Collaboration in Kanban vs. Scrum

**Kanban**

- Collaboration is continuous — tasks can be reprioritized anytime.
- Work items flow steadily, and each role picks up tasks as capacity allows.
- Less formal ceremonies but ongoing communication is key.

**Scrum**

- Collaboration happens in structured cycles (sprints).
- Roles plan together during sprint planning and coordinate daily in stand-ups.
- Defined ceremonies (planning, review, retrospective) promote alignment.
