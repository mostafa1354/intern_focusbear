     - Review upcoming stories for clarity and testability.
     - Identify potential risks and required test environments/data.
     - Estimate QA effort and plan testing tasks in alignment with dev timelines.

2. **Daily Standup**

   - **Purpose:** Share daily progress, identify blockers, align on goals.
   - **Participants:** Entire Scrum team.
   - **QA’s Role:**
     - Provide concise updates on testing progress and blockers.
     - Coordinate with developers on bug fixes and retesting priorities.
     - Highlight any urgent issues impacting sprint progress.

3. **Sprint Review**

## 📝 Reflection

### QA Actions Before, During & After Sprint Planning

- **Before:** Review backlog items, prepare test plans, identify risks, clarify unclear acceptance criteria.
- **During:** Ask questions to refine requirements, estimate testing effort, align timelines with dev tasks.
- **After:** Document testing scope and create necessary test cases or checklists.

### Keeping Daily Standups Concise

- Share only the most relevant updates:
  - What was tested yesterday.
  - What will be tested today.
  - Any blockers that need team help.
- Keep technical details for follow-up conversations outside the standup.

### Driving Continuous Improvement in Retrospectives

- Track QA metrics (e.g., number of bugs found post-release, time to test stories).
- Propose process changes such as earlier handoff for testing or parallel testing.
- Suggest better communication channels for bug reporting and tracking.

### Personal Example – Applying QA Practices

In a previous app project, I tested a quiz module where the **progress bar failed to update correctly** on iOS. I raised the issue during our daily standup, documented clear reproduction steps, and attached screenshots for the developers. Because the bug was identified and communicated early, the team was able to implement and validate a hotfix within the sprint. This experience showed me the value of concise updates in standups, detailed bug reporting, and active participation in retrospectives to suggest process improvements. As a Manual QA Intern at Focus Bear, I plan to apply the same practices surfacing blockers early, providing clear test evidence, and collaborating closely with developers—to keep sprints on track and ensure high-quality releases.
