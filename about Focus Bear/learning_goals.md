# What I Want to Learn & Contribute – Reflection

> File name: `learn_and_contribute.md`  
> Role: Manual Q&A Intern at Focus Bear

## What do I hope to learn from this internship?

- How a real product team ships features using Kanban (end-to-end flow from ticket → release).
- Strong manual testing practices: test design, risk-based prioritisation, regression strategy.
- Writing world-class bug reports (clear repro steps, scope, impact, evidence).
- Accessibility/usability considerations for neurodivergent users (reduce cognitive load).
- Practical security-by-default habits in QA (data handling, PII redaction, least privilege).

## What skills am I most excited to develop?

- **Test design & coverage**: boundary/edge cases, exploratory charters.
- **Defect communication**: concise titles, precise steps, expected vs actual, artifacts.
- **Light automation exposure** (smoke/regression ideas with tooling later).
- **Analytics-aware QA**: using logs/metrics to guide testing priorities.
- **Collaborative habits**: crisp stand-up updates, Kanban hygiene, async comms.

## What can I contribute to the team?

- Thorough manual regression on new features and critical paths.
- High-signal bug reports with screenshots/screencasts and environment details.
- Consistent Kanban updates (reduce “unknowns”, surface blockers early).
- Small QA templates/checklists to speed up repeats (e.g., release smoke list).
- Empathy-driven feedback for ADHD/Autism users (simplify flows, reduce steps).

## One area I feel less confident in (and want to improve)

- **Test automation foundations** (e.g., Playwright/Cypress basics) and when to automate vs keep manual.  
  _Plan:_ shadow an engineer, follow a 2–3 hour intro, automate one happy-path smoke by the end of the internship.

## What does success look like for me?

- **Quality outcomes**
  - Zero critical defects escaping on the flows I tested.
  - ≥90% of my bug reports closed without “needs more info”.
- **Process outcomes**
  - Daily, useful stand-up updates; board always reflects reality.
  - A reusable **release smoke checklist** adopted by the team.
- **Growth outcomes**
  - Ship 1 small QA improvement (template or doc) that others use.
  - Complete an intro automation task and demo it.
  - Document accessibility/usability insights specific to our users.
