### 4. No Alarm or Notification After Focus Session

## üí° Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Add proper lock behavior for Super Strict Mode**

   - Make sure all other features are disabled until the timer ends.

2. **Improve Focus Timer End Behavior**

   - Add an **alarm sound, vibration, or push notification** when time is up.

3. **Fix or Clarify Friction Menu**

   - If it‚Äôs a bug, fix navigation. If it‚Äôs not ready, show a message like _‚ÄúComing soon.‚Äù_

4. **Allow Limited Navigation When Blocking is Paused**

   - Instead of blocking the whole app, allow users to at least explore settings or stats.

5. **Require Email Verification Before Login**
   - Improve onboarding by forcing verification before granting access.
