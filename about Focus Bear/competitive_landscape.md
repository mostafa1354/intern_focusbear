## 📝 Reflection

**What makes Focus Bear different?**

- Combines _distraction blocking_ **and** _habit/routine guidance_ in a single app.
- Designed with neurodivergent productivity challenges in mind (ADHD-friendly).
- Integrates habit tracking, daily routine prompts, and app/site blocking without switching platforms.
- Desktop + mobile availability with consistent UI.

**If I were a user, why would I choose Focus Bear over competitors?**

- I’d choose Focus Bear if I needed both **focus enforcement** (blocking distractions) and **structured routines** in the same app.
- Its routine reminders and visual progress tracking make it feel supportive rather than restrictive.
- Designed for long-term habit building, not just short-term focus sessions.

**One feature another app has that Focus Bear doesn’t:**

- Freedom’s **multi-device block sync** (start a session on one device, instantly applied to all logged-in devices).

**One improvement Focus Bear could make:**

- Add **real-time multi-device syncing** for blocking sessions and routines — so if I start a focus session on my phone, it automatically applies to my laptop without manually starting it there.
