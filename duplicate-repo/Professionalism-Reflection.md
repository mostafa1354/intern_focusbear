## Reflection

### Examples of Professional vs. Unprofessional Behaviour

**Professional:**

- Responding to messages in a timely and respectful tone.
- Being punctual for meetings and prepared with relevant notes or questions.
- Giving feedback based on facts and observations, not personal opinions.
- Offering help when teammates are stuck.

**Unprofessional:**

- Ignoring assigned tasks or deadlines without communication.
- Using sarcasm or negative tone in written communication.
- Interrupting others during meetings without letting them finish.
- Reacting defensively to constructive feedback.

### Respectful Communication in Remote Teams

- Use **clear, concise language** with no unnecessary jargon.
- Assume **good intent** when interpreting others’ messages.
- Handle disagreements privately first, then escalate if unresolved.
- Acknowledge messages even if I can’t reply in full immediately.

---

### Giving and Receiving Feedback Professionally

- **Giving:** Focus on the behaviour/action, not the person. Provide examples and suggestions for improvement.
- **Receiving:** Listen without interrupting, ask clarifying questions, and reflect before responding.

### Example of Great Teamwork I’ve Experienced

During a group university project, each member shared daily updates and helped each other troubleshoot issues. Clear communication and mutual respect meant tasks were completed on time, and the environment was supportive.

### Being Proactive in My Internship

- Offer ideas for improving QA processes.
- Volunteer to test new features early.

### Following Up & Escalating

- If I need information/action:
  1. Send a polite reminder after 24–48 hours.
  2. If still no response, follow up via a faster channel (e.g., direct message or call).
  3. Escalate to a supervisor if urgent and unresolved after reasonable attempts.

### Things I Won’t Do

- Gossip or speak negatively about colleagues.
- Ignore deadlines without communication.
- React emotionally in professional channels.
- Share confidential information outside the company.
