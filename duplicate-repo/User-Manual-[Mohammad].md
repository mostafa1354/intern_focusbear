## How I Work Best

- I do my best work when I have **clear, detailed test scenarios** and enough time for thorough testing.
- I struggle when there are **last-minute scope changes** without updated documentation or when communication is unclear.

---

## Communication Style

- I prefer messages to be **short but clear**, ideally with links or references to relevant tasks/issues.
- The best way to reach me is **Discord** for quick questions, and **email** for detailed updates.
- If you need something urgent, **tag me directly** in Discord and mark it as high priority.

---

## Collaboration & Teamwork

- I work best in a team when everyone shares updates regularly and blockers are discussed openly.
- My biggest pet peeve in teamwork is **not knowing about changes until it’s too late** to adjust my tests.
- If I seem quiet in a meeting, it usually means I’m **taking detailed notes** or reviewing test scenarios in my head.

---

## Focus & Productivity

- I stay focused by **working in structured testing sessions**, often in quiet or with soft background music.
- Things that distract me: frequent context switching, unclear priorities.
- The best way to support my productivity is to **give me clear priorities** and **avoid unnecessary interruptions** during test execution.

---

## Feedback & Growth

- I like feedback to be **direct, constructive, and supported with examples**.
- When I make a mistake, the best way to let me know is **privately with clear guidance on how to fix it**.
- I appreciate it when teammates **share solutions or tips** that could improve my testing process.

---

## Fun Facts & Quirks

- One thing people often misunderstand about me is that **silence doesn’t mean I’m disengaged — it means I’m analyzing or documenting**.
- A fun fact about me: I enjoy spotting tiny details that others might miss — it’s like a puzzle for me.
- My work superpower is **catching edge-case bugs that could slip into production**.
