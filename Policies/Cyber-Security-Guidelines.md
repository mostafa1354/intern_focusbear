## Phishing Alert Story – Norton Security Email

Last month, I received an email claiming I had purchased **Norton Security** and attached a bill.  
Since I hadn’t made any purchase, I treated it as a **suspected phishing attempt**.

### Steps I Took:

- ❌ I **did not click** any links or open attachments.
- 🔍 I **verified independently** by checking:
  - My **bank account** → no charges found.
  - My **Norton account via the official website** → no purchase recorded.
- 🚫 I used my email client’s **Report as Spam/Phishing** option.
- 🗑️ I then **deleted the email**.
