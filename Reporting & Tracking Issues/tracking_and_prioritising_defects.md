# ‚ö° Tracking and Prioritising Defects

## Role Context

Manual Q&A Intern at Focus Bear.  
As part of my role, I log and track defects, ensuring they are categorized and prioritized effectively so that the development team can address the most impactful issues first.

## üîç Research & Learn

### Difference Between Bug Severity and Bug Priority

- **Severity**: How badly the defect impacts the system‚Äôs functionality or user experience.
  - Example: A login failure has **high severity** because it blocks access to the app.
  - Example: A small spelling mistake has **low severity** because it doesn‚Äôt affect functionality.
- **Priority**: How urgently the bug should be fixed based on business needs.
  - Example: A payment processing failure has **high priority** even if it‚Äôs rare.
  - Example: A typo in a rarely used settings page may have **low priority**.

### How Teams Decide Which Bugs to Fix First

- **Business Impact** ‚Äì Does it affect revenue or critical user workflows?
- **Risk** ‚Äì Could it cause data loss, security issues, or major outages?
- **Frequency** ‚Äì How often does it occur?
- **Effort vs. Value** ‚Äì Is it quick to fix compared to the benefit?
- **User Experience** ‚Äì Does it frustrate or confuse users significantly?

### Tools for Tracking Defects in Agile

- GitHub Issues / Projects
- Jira
- Trello
- Linear
- Asana (with bug tracking workflows)

### When Teams Disagree on Priority

- Discuss the **impact and scope** with stakeholders.
- Provide data (logs, user reports, business metrics) to justify the importance.
- Negotiate a compromise, such as scheduling it for the next sprint.
- Escalate to a product manager if agreement can‚Äôt be reached.

## üìù Reflection

### How I Would Prioritise a Cosmetic UI Issue vs. a Login Failure

- **Cosmetic UI Issue** ‚Äì Low severity, low priority unless it affects brand perception significantly.
- **Login Failure** ‚Äì High severity, high priority since it blocks all user access.

### If a Developer Says a Bug is Too Minor to Fix

- I would explain the potential **long-term impact** (e.g., credibility, user trust).
- Suggest **scheduling it later** instead of ignoring it.
- Keep it logged in the backlog to avoid being forgotten.

### How to Ensure Low-Priority Bugs Don‚Äôt Get Forgotten

- Keep them **documented in the tracking system** with clear details.
- Review backlog regularly during sprint planning or backlog grooming.
- Tag them appropriately for easy retrieval.
