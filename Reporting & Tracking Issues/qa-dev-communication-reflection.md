# 📢 Communicating Effectively with Developers

## Role Context

Manual Q&A Intern at Focus Bear.  
My role involves identifying, reporting, and discussing bugs with developers so that they are clearly understood, correctly prioritized, and fixed efficiently without causing tension or delays.

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### Best Practices for Communicating Bugs

- **Be clear and specific**: Include exact steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, and screenshots or recordings.
- **Focus on facts, not blame**: Describe the problem without assigning fault.
- **Provide relevant context**: Mention affected environment (OS, browser, device type), build version, and related features.
- **Prioritize appropriately**: Use severity and priority labels so developers know the urgency.
- **Be concise**: Avoid unnecessary details that might obscure the core issue.

### Providing Useful Feedback Without Overwhelming Developers

- Report only verified and reproducible bugs (or clearly mark them as intermittent).
- Group related issues together when possible.
- Avoid flooding developers with low-priority items during high-pressure release periods—log them but mark as “low priority”.

### Common Misunderstandings & How to Avoid Them

- **Vague bug reports** → Provide detailed reproduction steps.
- **Assumptions about cause** → Let developers investigate root cause before suggesting fixes.
- **Unclear priority** → Agree on severity and priority criteria beforehand.
- **Different terminology** → Use agreed-upon definitions for testing terms.

### Good vs. Bad Bug Report Conversations

- **Good**:  
  QA: “When logging in with incorrect credentials, I received a 500 error (screenshot attached). Steps to reproduce are listed. This occurs only in the staging environment.”  
  Dev: “Thanks, I’ll check the login validation code in staging.”

- **Bad**:  
  QA: “Login is broken, please fix.”  
  Dev: “What do you mean? I can’t reproduce it.”

### When to Escalate an Issue

- When a critical bug blocks releases and is not being addressed after initial follow-up.
- If multiple reminders are sent without acknowledgment.
- If the issue is security-related or affects a large portion of users.

## 📝 Reflection

### If a Developer Says They Can’t Reproduce a Bug

- Re-check my own reproduction steps and environment.
- Provide additional evidence such as a screen recording or logs.
- Offer to replicate the issue live on a call or screen share.

### Avoiding Blame While Pushing for Fixes

- Focus on **“what is happening”** instead of **“who caused it”**.
- Frame bugs as **shared problems** to solve.
- Use language like “I noticed…” or “The system behaves like this…” instead of “You broke…”.

### Keeping Bug Discussions Constructive

- Always start with acknowledgment of developer efforts.
- Be solution-focused: suggest ways to reproduce or isolate the issue.
- Respect developer time—combine updates instead of sending multiple uncoordinated messages.
