# üéØ Understanding How to Do Manual QA

## Role Context

Manual Q&A Intern at Focus Bear.  
My role involves testing the app‚Äôs features to ensure they work correctly, meet user expectations, and align with the unique needs of our target audience ‚Äî including neurodivergent users. This requires adaptability, attention to detail, and applying context-driven testing principles.

## üîç Research & Learn

### What is Manual QA Testing?

- Manual QA testing is the process of a human tester executing tests without the use of automation tools.
- It focuses on **real-time observation, adaptability, and critical thinking**, allowing the tester to uncover unexpected issues.
- Unlike automation, manual QA can evaluate **usability, user experience, and edge cases** that scripted tools may miss.

### What is Context-Driven Testing?

- Context-driven testing, popularized by **James Bach and Michael Bolton**, argues that **there are no best practices ‚Äî only good practices in context**.
- Testing should adapt to:
  - The product‚Äôs purpose.
  - The team‚Äôs goals.
  - The constraints and risks present at that time.
- It challenges rigid, one-size-fits-all QA processes and focuses on tailoring testing to the **specific situation**.

### Seven Principles of Context-Driven Testing

1. The value of any practice depends on its context.
2. There are good practices in context, but no best practices.
3. People, working together, are the most important part of any project‚Äôs context.
4. Projects unfold over time in ways that are often unpredictable.
5. The product is a solution; if the problem isn‚Äôt solved, the product doesn‚Äôt work.
6. Good software testing is a challenging intellectual process.
7. Only through judgment and skill, exercised cooperatively throughout the entire project, are we able to do the right things at the right times to effectively test our products.

### Exploratory vs. Scripted Testing

- **Exploratory Testing**:
  - Tester designs and executes tests simultaneously.
  - Best for discovering **unexpected bugs** and usability issues.
  - Flexible and adaptable to changes.
- **Scripted Testing**:
  - Follows predefined test cases.
  - Best for regression testing and validating specific requirements.
  - Ensures consistency and repeatability.

### Skills of a Great Manual Tester (James Bach & Experts)

- Curiosity and critical thinking.
- Ability to adapt to changing project needs.
- Strong observation skills.
- Clear communication for reporting issues.
- Technical awareness of how the product works.
- Empathy for the end-user experience.

## üìù Reflection

### Why Context Matters

- Every app has a unique audience, purpose, and risk profile.
- **Testing Focus Bear** involves considering neurodivergent users who may interact differently with productivity tools ‚Äî meaning usability and accessibility require more emphasis than in many other apps.

### Structured Yet Adaptable Testing

- I can follow structured regression checklists for stability.
- I can adapt in real-time using exploratory testing to investigate unexpected behaviors.

### Approach Without a Predefined Script

- Start by exploring the feature as a user would.
- Identify core functions, edge cases, and possible user mistakes.
- Document observations and any unclear behaviors.
- Compare outcomes against user expectations and project goals.

### Deciding What to Test Without Requirements

- Identify **most critical workflows** first.
- Use risk-based thinking to focus on high-impact areas.
- Ask clarifying questions to the product or development team if uncertain.
- Leverage past defect patterns to guide exploration.
