# 🏆 Core Manual QA Skills – Testing as an Investigative Process

## Role Context

Manual Q&A Intern at Focus Bear.  
My work involves more than following predefined test scripts—it requires investigative thinking, curiosity, and adaptability to find issues that may not be documented or anticipated.

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### How Exploratory Testing Helps Uncover Bugs

- Allows testers to follow **clues** in the software’s behavior rather than rigidly following scripts.
- Enables adaptation in real-time as new observations are made.
- Can surface **unexpected bugs** caused by unusual workflows or data combinations.
- Encourages testing in **user-like patterns**, not just developer-defined scenarios.

### Techniques for Investigating Software Behavior

- **Follow the data flow**: Observe how data is entered, processed, stored, and displayed.
- **Vary inputs**: Use edge cases, invalid values, and boundary testing.
- **State transition exploration**: Move the application between states in unexpected ways.
- **Pair testing**: Collaborate with another tester or developer to brainstorm new scenarios.
- **Time-based testing**: Check how the system behaves after delays, rapid inputs, or session timeouts.

### How Questioning Skills Help Uncover Hidden Issues

- Asking “What if?” helps identify untested scenarios.
- “Why did this happen?” leads to deeper investigation when something unexpected occurs.
- “What else could be affected?” expands the scope to related features.
- “Is this consistent?” prompts comparison with similar functionality elsewhere in the app.

### Strategies When There Are No Clear Requirements

- Use **heuristics** like CRUD, Boundaries, Zero-One-Many.
- Compare with similar features to guess intended behavior.
- Focus on core user workflows and business value.
- Engage with stakeholders or the Product Manager for clarifications.

## 📝 Reflection

### Questions I Would Ask When Testing a New Focus Bear Feature

1. What is the **primary goal** of this feature for the user?
2. What are the **entry points** and **exit points** of the workflow?
3. How does this feature **interact with existing functionality**?
4. What happens if I use **unexpected inputs** or skip steps?
5. Are there **edge cases** for specific devices, browsers, or user settings?

### How Uncertainty and Curiosity Make Me a Better Tester

- **Uncertainty** keeps me from assuming the software works as expected.
- **Curiosity** drives me to explore beyond the “happy path” and discover subtle issues.
- Both encourage ongoing learning and deeper understanding of the system.

### Techniques for Digging Deeper into Difficult-to-Reproduce Bugs

- Reproduce in different environments (OS, browser, network speed).
- Add logging or enable debug mode to capture more context.
- Break down the workflow into smaller, testable steps.
- Use screen recording to capture the exact moment of failure.
- Collaborate with developers to identify possible root causes.
