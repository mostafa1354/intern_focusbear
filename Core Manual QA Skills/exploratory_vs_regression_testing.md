# üîÄ Exploratory Testing vs. Regression Testing

## Role Context

Manual Q&A Intern at Focus Bear.  
My role involves balancing exploratory and regression testing to ensure both discovery of new issues and stability of existing features.

## üîç Research & Learn

### What is Exploratory Testing?

- A testing approach where the tester actively explores the application without a predefined script.
- Combines learning, test design, and test execution simultaneously.
- Relies on tester creativity, curiosity, and product knowledge.
- Helps identify **unexpected issues** by simulating real user behavior.

### What is Regression Testing?

- A structured testing approach that re-checks previously working functionality after updates or bug fixes.
- Ensures that **new changes** haven‚Äôt broken existing features.
- Uses **predefined test cases** for consistency and repeatability.
- Crucial for maintaining product stability.

### When to Use Each Approach

**Exploratory Testing** is best for:

- New or recently updated features.
- Early-stage development where documentation is incomplete.
- Discovering usability or UX-related issues.
- Investigating unusual or intermittent bugs.

**Regression Testing** is best for:

- Before and after releases.
- Validating bug fixes.
- Maintaining confidence in core features.
- Ensuring stability after large code changes.

### How Exploratory Testing Reveals Missed Bugs

- Allows testers to deviate from the ‚Äúhappy path.‚Äù
- Simulates user mistakes, unusual workflows, and unexpected data inputs.
- Finds **hidden issues** that strict test cases might overlook.

## üìù Reflection

### Why Exploratory Testing is Useful for Focus Bear

- Focus Bear serves a diverse audience, including neurodivergent users who may interact with the app in unique ways.
- Exploratory testing allows me to think like different types of users and uncover real-world usability issues.
- Encourages finding **edge cases** that automated or scripted regression testing might miss.

---

### Risks of Over-Reliance on One Approach

- **Too much exploratory testing**: Risk of missing consistent coverage of critical workflows, leading to regressions in core features.
- **Too much regression testing**: Risk of missing new or unexpected bugs, especially in complex workflows or new features.

### Documenting and Reporting Issues from Exploratory Testing

1. Clearly describe the steps taken ‚Äî even if not strictly scripted.
2. Include environment details (device, OS, browser, app version).
3. Provide screenshots, screen recordings, and logs when possible.
4. Indicate severity and possible impact.
5. Suggest possible reproduction paths if the bug is intermittent.
