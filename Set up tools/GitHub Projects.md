# 📝 GitHub Projects – Reflection

## 🎯 Goal

Understand how GitHub Projects is used to track issues and manage QA tasks.

---

## ❓ Why is this important?

GitHub Projects provides a structured way for QA interns to organise, prioritise, and track tasks while collaborating with the development team. It ensures that bugs and feature requests are clearly documented, assigned to the right person, and moved through the workflow until resolved.

## 🔍 Research & Learn

**What are GitHub Projects, and how do they work?**  
GitHub Projects is a visual task management tool integrated with GitHub repositories. It uses a board layout (similar to Kanban) to track tasks as cards, which can represent issues, pull requests, or notes. Each card moves across columns (e.g., _To Do_, _In Progress_, _Done_) to reflect progress.

**How are issues created, assigned, and moved?**

- **Creation** – Issues are created in a repository with a title, description, screenshots, or reproduction steps.
- **Assignment** – Issues can be assigned to specific team members responsible for resolving them.
- **Movement** – As work progresses, the issue card is moved from _To Do_ → _In Progress_ → _Done_.

**What are labels, milestones, and assignees in GitHub issues?**

- **Labels** – Tags (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `high-priority`) that categorise issues.
- **Milestones** – Group issues into a larger deliverable or release goal.
- **Assignees** – Indicate who is responsible for completing the issue.

**How can you use GitHub Projects to track testing progress?**  
By creating a dedicated QA board or filtering issues by labels such as `QA` or `bug`, testers can clearly see which tasks are pending, in testing, or verified as fixed.

## 📝 Reflection

**How would you create a new issue for a bug found during testing?**

1. Go to the repository’s **Issues** tab.
2. Click **New Issue** and provide a clear title.
3. In the description, outline steps to reproduce, expected vs actual results, and attach screenshots if needed.
4. Apply the `bug` and `QA` labels, assign to the relevant developer, and link it to the appropriate GitHub Project column (_To Do_).

**How can you prioritise issues in a GitHub Project?**

- Use **labels** like `high-priority` or `critical`.
- Place urgent tasks at the top of the _To Do_ column.
- Link to milestones that align with upcoming releases.

**What are some advantages of using GitHub Projects for tracking QA tasks?**

- Keeps all bugs and tasks centralised with relevant details.
- Provides real-time visibility for both QA and development teams.
- Integrates with pull requests, making it easier to verify fixes.
- Improves accountability by clearly showing assignees and due dates.
