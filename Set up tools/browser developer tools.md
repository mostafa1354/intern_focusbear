# 🔍 Browser Developer Tools – Reflection

## 🎯 Goal

Understand how to inspect elements, monitor network requests, view console logs, and debug issues using browser developer tools.

---

## ❓ Why is this important?

Browser developer tools (DevTools) allow QA testers to investigate UI and functionality issues directly in the browser. They help identify JavaScript errors, track API activity, test performance under different network conditions, and collect precise technical information for bug reports — making collaboration with developers more efficient.

## 🔍 Research & Learn

**Main features of browser developer tools in Chrome & Firefox:**

- **Elements / Inspector Tab** – View and edit HTML/CSS in real time to diagnose UI layout issues.
- **Console Tab** – Shows JavaScript errors, warnings, and custom log messages.
- **Network Tab** – Displays all requests made by the page (e.g., API calls, images, scripts) and their status codes.
- **Sources Tab** – Allows stepping through JavaScript code to debug logic.
- **Performance Tab** – Records runtime performance for analysis.
- **Application Tab** – Shows local storage, session storage, cookies, and cached data.
- **Responsive Design Mode** (Firefox) / **Device Toolbar** (Chrome) – Simulates different screen sizes and devices.

**Checking for JavaScript errors in the Console:**

1. Open DevTools (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` on Windows, `Cmd+Opt+I` on Mac).
2. Go to **Console** tab.
3. Look for red error messages, noting file names, line numbers, and error details.

**Using the Network tab to monitor API requests:**

1. Open **Network** tab.
2. Refresh the page or perform an action that triggers an API call.
3. Filter by “XHR” or “Fetch” to see API requests.
4. Click a request to view headers, request payload, and response data.

**Simulating different network conditions:**

- In Chrome’s **Network** tab, select “Online” → choose **Slow 3G**, **Fast 3G**, or create a custom throttling profile.
- Firefox: Use the **Network Throttling** option in the Network panel.

## 📝 Reflection

**Using DevTools to confirm if an API call is successful or failing:**

- Check the **Network** tab for the API request.
- Review the **Status Code** (200 = success, 4xx/5xx = failure).
- Inspect the **Response** tab for returned data or error messages.

**Debugging a UI issue that only happens in one browser:**

- Use the **Elements** tab to inspect CSS rules applied.
- Compare styles and scripts between browsers.
- Look for console errors that might indicate unsupported features.

**Information from DevTools most useful for reporting a frontend bug:**

- Screenshot of **Console** showing error details.
- API call request/response data from the **Network** tab.
- CSS/HTML snippets from the **Elements** tab.
- Browser version, OS details, and steps to reproduce.
